    'Over the last few months, I quickly picked up several technologies and built three projects, each with unique tech stacks. I am proud to have designed a kanban board on my full stack project that feels very familiar to my own work experiences using Asana and JIRA. Currently, I am working with a small group of engineers in creating an original multiplayer game - take a look below!',
